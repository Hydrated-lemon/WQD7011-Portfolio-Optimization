# Portfolio Optimisation using Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Portfolio Optimisation using Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods," completed as part of the WQD7011: Numerical Optimization course at the University of Malaya.

## Project Overview

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) provides a framework for constructing investment portfolios that optimize the balance between risk and return. This project focuses on implementing and comparing two optimization techniques: Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods.


## Introduction

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, is a cornerstone of modern finance. This project leverages MPT to optimize portfolios using Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods, focusing on the Hang Seng Index dataset, available at https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/portinfo.html.

1. `port1.txt`: Includes covariance matrices and expected return vectors for a range of asset sizes.
2. `portef1.txt`: The theoretical efficient frontier
3. `WQD7011_project_codes`: Matlab Codes
4. `Final_report.pdf`: Final Report

## Mathematical Formulation

The project involves several mathematical formulations:

1. **Standard Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory (MVPT)**
2. **MVPT with Cardinality Constraint**

These formulations help in defining and solving optimization problems. Refer to `Final_report.pdf`.

## Optimization Techniques

Two primary optimization techniques are explored:

1. **Quadratic Programming**
2. **Monte Carlo Methods**

## Results and Analysis

The results include analysis and comparison of the portfolios optimized using both Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods. Key findings and limitations are discussed in detail.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The project concludes with insights gained from the optimization techniques and suggests areas for future research and improvement, such as incorporating more realistic constraints and exploring additional optimization methods.
